Scope of the “Where My Workload Is” Feature

The “Where My Workload Is” feature aims to provide detailed visibility into the activity and operational state of workloads across the infrastructure. The scope includes the following functionalities and boundaries:

1. Data Collection
	•	Collect CPU utilization metrics from:
	•	Virtual Machines (VMs).
	•	Physical Machines (PMs).
	•	Determine the active or passive state of individual servers based on predefined thresholds of CPU utilization.

2. Data Aggregation
	•	Aggregate server-level activity data to provide a data center-level status:
	•	Active Data Center: All or a significant portion of servers are active.
	•	Passive Data Center: Majority of servers are passive or underutilized.

3. Real-Time Monitoring
	•	Provide real-time or near real-time visibility into:
	•	Which servers are active or passive.
	•	The active/passive status of data centers.

4. User Interface
	•	Display the data in a user-friendly dashboard:
	•	Visual representation of active/passive workloads at server and data center levels.
	•	Filtering options to view specific data centers or servers.

5. Reporting and Insights
	•	Generate reports on:
	•	Utilization trends over time.
	•	Resource usage at server and data center levels.
	•	Insights into potential resource optimization opportunities.

6. Integration with Existing Systems
	•	Integrate seamlessly with:
	•	Monitoring tools (e.g., Prometheus, Grafana).
	•	Infrastructure management platforms (e.g., VMware vSphere, OpenStack).

7. Limitations and Assumptions
	•	Assumptions:
	•	CPU utilization is the primary metric for determining activity.
	•	Thresholds for active/passive states are predefined and configurable.
	•	Limitations:
	•	Does not consider other performance metrics (e.g., memory, disk I/O) for activity determination.
	•	Dependent on the accuracy and availability of underlying monitoring data.

Out of Scope
	•	Managing or modifying workloads directly (e.g., starting/stopping servers).
	•	Comprehensive performance analysis beyond CPU utilization.
	•	Predictive analytics or AI-driven optimization (could be a future enhancement).

The scope ensures that the feature remains focused on providing actionable insights into workload activity while laying the groundwork for future expansions such as multi-metric analysis and predictive capabilities.
