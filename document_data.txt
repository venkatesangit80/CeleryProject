Page Title

Where Is My Workload? – Business Logic for Capacity Planning Platform

1. Overview and Objective
	1.	Purpose:
[Describe why this document exists. For example: “To provide a detailed overview of the business logic for identifying where a workload resides within our Capacity Planning Platform.”]
	2.	Scope:
[Specify the boundaries. For example: “Covers data ingestion, business logic, and user interface considerations for identifying workload location, but does not address cost modeling.”]

2. Background and Context
	1.	Business Context:
[Explain what problem this functionality solves. For instance: “Teams need a unified view of which environment (on-prem/cloud) their workloads are deployed to, to make informed capacity decisions.”]
	2.	Target Audience:
[List roles such as finance, engineering, resource management, etc.]
	3.	Key Definitions/Glossary:
	•	Workload: [Definition here]
	•	Cluster: [Definition here]
	•	Capacity: [Definition here]
	•	(Add more as needed)

3. High-Level Architecture
	1.	System Diagram:
[Insert or link a diagram showing how the “Where Is My Workload?” feature connects with the rest of the Capacity Planning Platform.]
	2.	Technology Stack:
	•	Front-end: [e.g., React, Angular]
	•	Back-end: [e.g., Node.js, Java services]
	•	Databases: [e.g., PostgreSQL, MongoDB]
	•	Integration Tools: [e.g., REST APIs, message queues]

4. Functional Business Logic
	1.	Key Use Cases / User Scenarios:
	•	Use Case 1: [e.g., “User searches for workload by ID to see if it’s on-prem or cloud.”]
	•	Use Case 2: [e.g., “Capacity manager views overall resource consumption for a particular workload.”]
	•	Use Case 3: [Add more scenarios as needed]
	2.	Core Business Rules:
	•	Data Validation Rules: [e.g., “A workload must always have a valid environment ID.”]
	•	Visibility Rules: [e.g., “Only users in the same department can view certain workloads.”]
	•	Aggregation Logic: [e.g., “Data is summarized weekly for forecasting.”]
	3.	Logic Flow Diagram:
[Add a flowchart or sequence diagram illustrating how data moves when a user searches for workload location.]

5. Data Model and Entities
	1.	Entity Definitions:
	•	Workload Entity: [List fields such as workload ID, environment, cluster name, etc.]
	•	Capacity Entity: [List fields such as resource type, allocated capacity, used capacity.]
	•	Cost Entity (If applicable): [List fields if cost modeling is part of the logic.]
	2.	Relationships:
[Explain how entities relate: e.g., “One workload can map to multiple capacity entries over time.”]
	3.	Data Flow:
[Outline where the data comes from (source), how it’s transformed, and where it’s stored (final DB, warehouse, etc.).]

6. Technical Design Details
	1.	APIs and Microservices:
	•	[List relevant API endpoints for retrieving “Where Is My Workload?” information (e.g., GET /workloads/{id}).]
	2.	Data Processing Pipelines:
	•	[Describe any batch or real-time processes that update workload location data or capacity metrics.]
	3.	Performance Considerations:
	•	[Expected data volumes, concurrency, response time goals, caching strategies, etc.]

7. User Interface / UX
	1.	UI Wireframes or Mockups:
[Insert images or links to your design prototypes showing how users will find “Where Is My Workload?”]
	2.	Interaction Flows:
	•	[Detail user actions step-by-step, e.g., “User logs in, navigates to Workloads tab, enters search criteria, results appear.”]

8. Security and Access Control
	1.	Authorization and Roles:
	•	[Identify which roles can see workload locations. Mention role-based access controls, if any.]
	2.	Data Governance:
	•	[Mention if PII is involved, or any compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.).]
	•	[State how data is encrypted at rest and in transit.]

9. Deployment and Release Strategy
	1.	Environments:
	•	[List Dev, Test, Staging, Production, and how code moves between them.]
	2.	Deployment Pipeline (CI/CD):
	•	[Describe steps from code commit to production deploy, including tests and approvals.]
	3.	Versioning:
	•	[Explain how changes to this functionality are tracked, e.g., Git branching strategy, release notes, etc.]

10. Testing and Validation
	1.	Testing Approach:
	•	[Unit tests, integration tests, end-to-end tests, acceptance tests, etc.]
	2.	Test Scenarios:
	•	[Examples: “Retrieve workload that doesn’t exist,” “User not authorized,” “Data incomplete.”]
	3.	Quality Metrics:
	•	[Benchmarks for performance, accuracy, availability, etc.]

11. Monitoring and Alerting
	1.	Logging:
	•	[What logs are captured for “Where Is My Workload?” queries—request ID, timestamps, etc.]
	2.	Metrics:
	•	[KPIs such as average response time, total queries, error rate over time.]
	3.	Alerts & Incident Response:
	•	[Thresholds for alerting. Outline on-call rotation and escalation procedures.]

12. Future Enhancements and Roadmap
	1.	Planned Improvements:
	•	[List next steps, such as “Add automated scaling suggestions” or “Incorporate cost optimization data.”]
	2.	Open Questions:
	•	[Document any unresolved items or pending decisions about data ownership, new compliance needs, etc.]

13. Appendices / References
	1.	Related Documentation:
	•	[Provide links to architecture diagrams, cost modeling pages, user guides, etc.]
	2.	Glossary:
	•	[Repeat or expand on the definitions from earlier if needed.]
	3.	Change Log:
	•	[Track major revisions to this Confluence document—date, author, summary of changes.]
