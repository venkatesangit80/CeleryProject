You’re welcome! I’m glad the solution improved the performance significantly. To handle the requirement of listening to Redis and processing new keys in real-time without polling every minute, we can leverage Redis Pub/Sub (Publish/Subscribe) or Redis Keyspace Notifications.

These features allow you to listen for events such as new keys being added, modified, or deleted, and trigger processing automatically when a new key that matches a certain pattern is created. This way, you can avoid periodically checking (polling) Redis and instead react to real-time events.

Approach: Using Redis Keyspace Notifications

Keyspace Notifications:

Redis allows you to subscribe to keyspace events, such as when a new key is created or modified. You can enable keyspace notifications, listen for relevant events, and then trigger your logic when a new key that matches your pattern is added to Redis.

Steps:

	1.	Enable Keyspace Notifications: In Redis, you need to configure it to notify your application when certain events occur, such as the addition of new keys.
	2.	Listen to Notifications: Your application will subscribe to the keyspace notification channel for specific events.
	3.	Process the New Keys: When a new key that matches the pattern is added, the application fetches the value, processes it, and writes it to a file.

Example Code: Listening for New Keys and Writing to Files

Here’s a Python example using Redis keyspace notifications:

Step 1: Enable Keyspace Notifications in Redis

First, make sure Redis keyspace notifications are enabled. You can do this by modifying the Redis configuration file (redis.conf) or dynamically via a Redis command.

To enable notifications for key creations and expirations:

CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events KEA

	•	K: Keyspace events
	•	E: Expiry events
	•	A: All events related to keys (e.g., set, del, expire)

You can set this permanently by modifying your redis.conf file:

notify-keyspace-events "KEA"

Step 2: Python Code to Listen for Keyspace Events

import redis
import threading

# Initialize Redis client
r = redis.StrictRedis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

# Pattern for Redis keys to match (replace with your actual key pattern)
pattern = 'metrics_*'

# Function to process a newly added key and write to a file
def process_new_key(key):
    file_name = f"{key.decode('utf-8')}.txt"
    # Fetch the value from Redis
    value = r.get(key)
    
    # Write the value to a file
    with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
        if value:
            f.write(value.decode('utf-8'))

# Function to listen for new key events and process them
def listen_for_new_keys():
    pubsub = r.pubsub()
    # Subscribe to keyspace events for 'set' commands (new key additions)
    pubsub.psubscribe('__keyspace@0__:*')  # '@0' refers to the Redis database number

    print("Listening for new keys...")

    for message in pubsub.listen():
        if message['type'] == 'pmessage':
            keyspace_event = message['channel'].decode('utf-8')
            key_name = message['data'].decode('utf-8')

            # Check if the key matches our pattern
            if key_name.startswith('metrics_'):
                print(f"Processing new key: {key_name}")
                process_new_key(key_name)

# Start listening for new keys in a separate thread
listener_thread = threading.Thread(target=listen_for_new_keys)
listener_thread.start()

How This Works:

	1.	Redis Notifications:
	•	The Redis CONFIG SET notify-keyspace-events KEA enables keyspace notifications so that Redis publishes events whenever keys are added, expired, or deleted.
	•	The Python code subscribes to keyspace events using psubscribe('__keyspace@0__:*'). This listens for all keyspace events in the default Redis database (db=0).
	2.	Processing New Keys:
	•	When a new key matching the pattern (e.g., metrics_*) is added, Redis sends an event, and the Python listener processes that key.
	•	The process_new_key function fetches the key’s value from Redis and writes it to a file.
	3.	Threading:
	•	The listen_for_new_keys function runs in its own thread so that it continuously listens for key events without blocking the main application.

Advantages of This Approach:

	•	No Polling: The application does not need to periodically poll Redis for new keys. It reacts to events in real-time.
	•	Efficient: The logic only runs when necessary, reducing unnecessary overhead.
	•	Scalable: As Redis automatically sends notifications, this approach scales well even with large numbers of keys being added frequently.

Handling Multiple Keys in a Single Event (Optional):

If you expect multiple keys to be added at once or in rapid succession, you can modify the logic to handle batch processing by collecting keys and processing them together in chunks.

Conclusion:

By using Redis keyspace notifications, you can build a more efficient solution that reacts in real-time to new keys matching your pattern. This eliminates the need for periodic polling and allows your application to respond immediately when new keys are added to Redis. The combination of listening for events and parallel file processing provides a scalable and performant way to handle new data in Redis.


Having a separate file for each of the 1382 keys may not be the most optimal solution for Prometheus scraping or for file management in general. While it’s technically feasible to create one file per key, it may lead to several issues:

1. File System Overhead:

	•	File Count: Creating and managing 1382 (or potentially more) files can put pressure on the file system. Many file systems perform less efficiently with large numbers of small files, leading to increased I/O latency, directory lookup times, and potential fragmentation.
	•	File Operations: Every time Prometheus scrapes, it would need to open each file, which introduces overhead. The more files it has to open and read, the longer the scrape will take. In extreme cases, this could impact Prometheus’ performance and lead to timeouts or delayed metric collection.

2. Prometheus Scraping:

	•	Prometheus is optimized for scraping metrics from a single endpoint (or a few large files), not for scraping many small files. Having multiple files for each key means Prometheus needs to parse each file separately, which could slow down scraping, especially as the number of keys (and thus files) grows.
	•	Prometheus prefers scraping from a single text file formatted in the Prometheus exposition format.

Optimal Solution: Consolidate Keys into Fewer Files or a Single File

A better approach would be to consolidate the metric data into fewer files, or ideally, a single file that Prometheus can scrape efficiently.

Two Potential Approaches:

Approach 1: Group Keys into Batches and Write to Batch Files

Instead of writing each key to a separate file, you can group keys into batches and write each batch to a single file. For example, you can group keys into batches of 100 and create 14 files (each containing metrics for 100 keys).

Example:

def process_and_write_batch_to_file(keys, file_name):
    pipeline = r.pipeline()
    for key in keys:
        pipeline.get(key)
    
    values = pipeline.execute()

    # Write all the fetched values for this batch to one file
    with open(file_name, 'w') as f:
        for value in values:
            if value:
                f.write(value.decode('utf-8') + '\n')

This reduces the number of files Prometheus needs to scrape, improving its performance while still distributing the data into manageable chunks.

Approach 2: Write All Metrics to a Single File

Another optimal approach for Prometheus would be to write all the metrics into a single file that follows the Prometheus text-based exposition format. Prometheus will scrape this file more efficiently than multiple small files, as it’s optimized for handling bulk metrics data.

Prometheus Text Format:

	•	The format looks like this:

# HELP <metric_name> <help>
# TYPE <metric_name> <type>
<metric_name>{label1="value1",label2="value2"} <value> <timestamp>


	•	You can write all the metrics from the Redis keys to this file in the required format, and Prometheus will scrape it at regular intervals.

Example for Writing All Metrics to a Single File:

def process_and_write_to_single_file(keys, file_name):
    pipeline = r.pipeline()
    for key in keys:
        pipeline.get(key)

    values = pipeline.execute()

    # Open the file in append mode so that multiple threads can write to it
    with open(file_name, 'a') as f:
        for value in values:
            if value:
                # Write the Prometheus formatted metrics
                f.write(f'metric_name{{label="some_value"}} {value.decode("utf-8")}\n')

This way, all the metrics for all the Redis keys are written into a single file, which Prometheus can scrape efficiently.

Benefits of Consolidating Metrics into Fewer Files:

	1.	Performance: Prometheus will perform better when scraping fewer files, especially a single file, as it can read and parse the metrics more efficiently.
	2.	Simpler File Management: Managing fewer files is easier and less prone to file system overhead compared to managing thousands of small files.
	3.	Reduced I/O Overhead: Writing to a single file or a few batch files reduces I/O operations and the need for Prometheus to open and read many individual files.

Considerations:

	•	File Size: If the consolidated file grows too large (e.g., in the GB range), it might affect performance. However, Prometheus is generally well-optimized for scraping large files if they’re in the correct format.
	•	Concurrency: If you have multiple threads writing to the same file, make sure to handle file access properly (e.g., use append mode) to avoid data corruption.
	•	Rotation: If the file becomes too large, you could implement log rotation or regularly clean up older data and keep only the most recent metrics.

Conclusion:

While creating a file for every key is technically feasible, it is not optimal for Prometheus scraping or for long-term performance. The recommended approach is to consolidate your Redis key values into fewer files, or ideally, into a single file in Prometheus’ text-based exposition format. This will significantly improve scraping performance and reduce file system overhead, while still allowing Prometheus to collect the necessary metrics.
