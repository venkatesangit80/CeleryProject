7. HashiCorp Vault for Config Management

HashiCorp Vault is used for storing all configuration items instead of environment variables. This approach allows for dynamic retrieval of configurations without the need to restart or redeploy Celery workers. Vault securely stores sensitive information and provides fine-grained access control, ensuring that configurations can be updated and accessed on-the-fly. This enhances the flexibility and security of the platform, allowing for seamless updates and management of configuration data.
